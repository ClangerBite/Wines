    """The 2018 Grand-Puy-Lacoste is fabulous, just as it was from barrel. Strong \
Cabernet inflections soar out of the glass, giving the wine a compelling \
aromatic profile laced with the essence of graphite, dried herbs, menthol \
and dark fruit. One of the most classic (for lack of a better word) wines \
in the Left Bank in 2018, Grand-Puy-Lacoste is super-impressive right out \
of the gate. Grand-Puy-Lacoste is ultimately a wine of tremendous class \
that remains restrained and aristocratic in breeding. Don't miss it.
